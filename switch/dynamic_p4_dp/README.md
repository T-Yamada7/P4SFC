# Dynamic P4 Data Plane of P4SFC
This program is written in P4_16 and is based on v1model, and its execution logic can be configured dynamically at runtime so as to deploy new SFCs.

## Run the dynamic P4 dp
To run the dynamic P4 dp, you need to compile the dynamic_dp.p4 first in your environment, and then load the compiled result into the programmable switch.

The commands are machine-dependent, and thus, we do not show the commands here.
